# User Story: Video Detail View

**ID:** US-003
**Feature:** Video Detail View

## User Story
As a **Content Creator**,
I want to **view a detailed page for a specific video**,
So that **I can watch the video, read the full synopsis, and see the high-resolution thumbnail.**

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  **Page Content:**
    *   The page is accessible via a unique URL (e.g., `/video/<uuid>`).
    *   **Title:** The full AI-generated title is displayed prominently.
    *   **Thumbnail:** The high-resolution generated thumbnail image is shown.
    *   **Synopsis:** The complete AI-generated synopsis/pitch is displayed as text.
    *   **Player:** An embedded video player allows the user to watch the full uploaded video.

2.  **Data Retrieval:**
    *   The system fetches the specific `metadata.json`, `video.mp4`, and `thumbnail.jpg` from the GCS bucket folder corresponding to the UUID.

3.  **Navigation:**
    *   The page should include a "Back to Library" link or button to return to the main catalog (US-002).

## Technical Notes
*   Ensure GCS objects are publicly accessible or signed URLs are generated by the backend so the browser can render the video and images.
