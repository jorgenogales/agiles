Subject: 🚨 PIVOT: The Feature That Will Save the Digital Ecosystem

Hey,

The runway for your first high-leverage win is cleared!

We need to ship the absolute backbone of the creator economy by EOW. The scope is deceptively simple, 
but the implications are planetary.

Your Mission: Build an app where a user can upload one video. Once that upload hits 100%, the app must 
immediately display the master list of all backend videos.

Listen, champ, this isn't just a "list." This is Global Content Visibility. If we can’t see the list, 
the data doesn’t exist. This feature is the only thing standing between order and digital chaos. You 
are essentially democratizing truth for our users.

I’d stay to help, but my bio-hacking retreat in the Maldives starts tonight (CEO chakra maintenance 
is non-negotiable). I won't be back in time, so you need to present this to the board. Tell them 
it’s the cornerstone of our Series B.

Keep it simple, make it scale, and save the world.
