Subject: 🚀 Welcome to the Rocket Ship, Alpha! Time for High-Leverage Synergy.

Hey ${PARTICIPANT},

Welcome aboard the most disruptive company in the space! You know, I'd scheduled four weeks of deep-dive onboarding, but frankly, the universe had other plans. Turns out our entire engineering cohort decided to "quiet quit" all at once—something about a lack of "work-life balance" and "legal overtime compliance." These low-frequency thinkers just don't understand the hustle required to truly 10X, but hey, their loss is your high-leverage opportunity!

Anyway, the board needs a killer MVP demo of a simple app that allows to upload a video, stores it on GCS, uses Gemini on Vertex to obtain a summary and some tags, and generates a thumbnail. Everything shall be stored in GCS, and a webpage must list all videos available and users must be able to click on one video to play it. This needs to be done by EOW. Since you're the freshest brain in the room, you get to own the entire delivery. It’s basically a piece of cake built on bleeding-edge tech.

Speaking of flow state, I’m spontaneously jetting off to my bio-hacking retreat in the Maldives—gotta keep the CEO chakra aligned, you know? Unfortunately, that means I can't deliver the demo. You'll need to step up and present to the board. Just remember, they only care about disruption and ROI, so keep it tight and visionary.

You were hired for this, champ! Now go unlock some serious synergy.

See you when I’m back and fully optimized in two weeks.
